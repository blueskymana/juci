<h2 id="JUCI-Webgui-for-Embedded-Routers">JUCI Webgui for Embedded Routers</h2>

<p>JUCI is a JavaScript-based web interface for broadband routers running Iopsys /
OpenWRT.</p>

<p>JUCI is built with html5, angularjs and bootstrap:</p>

<p><img src="/media/screenshot.jpg?raw=true" title="JUCI Screenshot" alt="Desktop" /></p>

<p>JUCI is theme-able and fully mobile-ready (responsive):</p>

<p><img src="/media/mobile.jpg" alt="Mobile" /></p>

<h2 id="What-is-JUCI-">What is JUCI? </h2>

<p>If offers you the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extremely resource-efficient for your device - your router only needs to run the core functions (which can be written in C!) and the gui itself is running entirely inside the client's browser). You router only computes and sends the minimum information necessary.</li>
<li>Full mobile support</li>
<li>Easy to work with - the code uses angular.js and html5, making it extremely easy to add new gui elements to the gui.</li>
<li>Full control and flexibility - yet many ready-made components: allowing you to pick yourself which level you want to develop on. There are no restrictions to the look and feel of your gui.</li>
<li>Dynamic theming - you can switch color themes at runtime.</li>
<li>Full language support - allowing for complete localization of your gui. Language file generation is even partially automatic (for html text). Also supporting dynamically changing language on page without having to reload the application. Also featuring quick debug mode for translations where you can see which strings are missing in currently used language pack.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="Usage-on-OpenWRT">Usage on OpenWRT</h2>

<p>You can now try JUCI on openwrt.</p>

<p>Here is how to install it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add my feed to your feeds.conf.default
src-git-full juci https://github.com/mkschreder/mks-openwrt-feed.git</p></li>
<li><p>Update and install the feed (with -f to force overrides)
./scripts/feeds update juci
./scripts/feeds install -f -p juci -a</p></li>
<li><p>select juci core, inteno theme and plugins under JUCI menu in menuconfig
(NOTE: some plugins conflict with eachother so you can not select
juci-broadcom-wl and juci-openwrt-wireless at the same time).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For example, you could append this to your .config and then do make defconfig:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-ubus-core=y
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-asterisk is not set
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-broadcom-dsl is not set
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-broadcom-ethernet is not set
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-broadcom-vlan is not set
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-broadcom-wl is not set
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-ddns=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-diagnostics=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-dnsmasq-dhcp=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-dropbear=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-ethernet=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-event=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-firewall-fw3=y
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-freecwmp is not set
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-igmpinfo is not set
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-inteno-multiwan is not set

# CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-utils is not set
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci-theme-inteno=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_juci=y
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>BUILD!</li>
</ul>


<p>Menus can be configured in /etc/config/juci. As a start you can use
juci.config.example and copy it to your router /etc/config/juci. Then you can
modify it to get the menus you want.  A better menu system is on the todo
list..</p>

<p>If you go to your router ip you should see the login screen. By default admin
user is used to login but if you don't have password set for admin user you
will not be able to login. So then go to the console and set password for admin
user or change the user used for logging in by editing /etc/config/rpcd and
then do /etc/init.d/rpcd restart.</p>

<p>JUCI also includes a nodejs server which you can do for local testing and for
forwarding jsonrpc calls to your router during testing (juci-local-server).</p>

<h2 id="Contribution">Contribution</h2>

<p>If you want to work on juci or if you are using juci yourself and make
modifications to it, it is usually a good idea if you submit your modifications
as patches. This can be done by using "git format-patch --stdout" and then
submitting the patch to me.</p>

<p>For detailed instructions on how to submit patches see:
<a href="https://github.com/mkschreder/juci/blob/master/docs/submitting-patches.md">Submitting Patches</a></p>

<p>(Note: if you make many modifications and never submit your modifications for
review then chances are that your codebase is slowly becoming a "pile of crap".
When this happens, eventually you will have to start with a fresh clone of juci
repo and readd your things because they have not been properly integrated in
the first place. So it is actually quite benefitial to submit patches when you
are doing continuous development).</p>

<h2 id="Good-to-know">Good to know</h2>

<p>Addons can be developed on top of juci by creating package that installs js and
css files into the router /www folder and then runs juci-update at postinstall
(index.html is actually generated automatically).</p>

<p>In most cases you will never need to modify core juci code. If you need to
change behavior of some function, you can always override the public function
in javascript without having to modify the original implementation.</p>

<p>Juci uses modified version of uhttpd that can serve gz files with proper
content type based on actual gzipped content.</p>

<p>JUCI also uses modified versions of ubus and rpcd on openwrt which you can also
install from the feed (using -f option).</p>

<h2 id="Getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>New: you can now find compiled juci manuals here:
<a href="http://mkschreder.github.io/juci/" data-bare-link="true">http://mkschreder.github.io/juci/</a></p>

<p>JUCI is designed to work primarily on OpenWRT based systems. Even if you surely
can use this code on other systems as well, a lot of functionality is
implemented in the backend using OpenWRT tools and packages. So you will
naturally need to build your firmware using openwrt to get the most of juci.</p>

<p>To install necessary tools to compile JUCI you can use the file
./scripts/ubuntu-bootstrap.sh. Run it using sudo.</p>

<p>JUCI is a collection of many files including individual javascript files, html
templates, translations and styles (written in LESS). All of these files need
to be built into a set of modules which can then be included as scripts into an
index.html page. This is done using make.</p>

<pre><code>make - without any arguments builds production files (minified and gzipped). 
make debug - builds uncompressed files for use with juci-local-server. 
</code></pre>

<p>When developing, it can be very good to use local server because it allows you
to continuously test your changes locally. Local server is a small program
written using node.js that starts a local http server while forwarding ubus
calls to a real box.</p>

<p>To run local server for testing new gui elements during development:</p>

<pre><code>./juci-local-server --host &lt;your router ip with juci installed>

now go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the local gui. 

when you make changes in code, run make debug again and reload the local page. 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="Common-Issues">Common Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I visit the home page and can not see anything. The homepage is blank.</p>

<p>  Solution: open up your browser console and see if you have some error printed there.</p></li>
<li><p>Juci fails to start. Says juci.ui.menu ubus call is missing.</p>

<p>  Solution: make sure ubus-scriptd is running on the router. And make sure it
  loads all scripts without errors. To check, do /etc/init.d/ubus-scriptd
  stop and then just run ubus-scriptd. It will print a trace. Now cancel it
  with ctrl+c and once you fix the errors restart it using
  /etc/init.d/ubus-scriptd start. Then make sure the necessary call is
  present in output of "ubus list"</p></li>
<li><p>I get to login page but can not login. What is the password?</p>

<p>  Solution: the login user is set in /etc/config/rpcd. Password is the unix
  password for that user - which you can change using passwd <var>username</var>.</p></li>
<li><p>I can login but get a big fat error box with a lot of text mentioning angular.</p>

<p>  Solution: this means that some module completely failed to initialize or
  that you have syntax error somewhere or that you have duplicate controller
  names or anything else that will cause an exception in angular. Usually the
  first thing to do is check browser console for any messages before the
  error. Then check the cryptic anuglar message mentioned in the error to get
  a clue on what to do next.</p></li>
<li><p>My page xyz can not access ubus. I get "Access Denied" in browser console.</p>

<p>  Solution: check that you have proper acl permissions configured in your
  access.json file in your plugin (if it is not there then create it - use
  existing plugins to see how). Then copy this file to your router and
  restart rpcd (/etc/init.d/rpcd restart). Then it should work.</p></li>
<li><p>My build process just hangs at line that contains "npm"</p>

<p>  Solution: build process needs connection to the internet to download
  necessary dependencies for some build scripts. If it is not possible then
  programs like "npm" may block indefinetely.</p></li>
<li><p>Compilation fails at "Compiling css/..juci.css.."</p>

<p>  Solution: this happens when yui-compressor (css minifier (which is written
  in java)) runs out of memory. This file tends to get large, and minifier
  needs more memory. Make sure your java VM is configured to use larger stack
  size (I find it amazing how easily java always wastes memory).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="Unit-testing">Unit testing</h2>

<p>NOTE: unit testing is no longer supported for now since sep 2015! But old files are still there.</p>

<p>Previously it was possible to run juci core in node js and make ubus calls
directly from command line. This functionality is still there and is
implemented in lib-juci in tests directory, but it has not been used for a
while so probably things have become outdated there. It would be nice in the
future to actually make most of the angular factories standalone modules
available through nodejs. This is not a difficult task because the code itself
is very easy to make into a standalone library not dependent on angular.</p>

<p>This is on the list of things to be done.</p>

<h2 id="Using-UCI-from-the-web-console">Using UCI from the web console</h2>

<p>It is possible to use UCI directly from your browser console. When you open
your console you will have a global uci object defined in the application.</p>

<pre><code>$uci.$sync("wireless") // will sync the wireless table
$uci.$sync(["wireless", "hosts"]) // will sync both wireless and hosts configs. 

$uci.wireless.wl0.channel.value = 1 // will set channel value to 1 

$uci.$save() // will save the uci config
</code></pre>

<p>All of the above methods return a promise. So if you need to run code AFTER the
operation completes, you have to set the done (or fail/always) callback for the returned
promise. You do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$uci.$sync("wireless").done(function(){
    console.log("Channel: "+$uci.wireless.wl0.channel.value); 
}).fail(function(){
    console.log("Failed to sync tables!"); 
}).always(function(){
    console.log("Done!"); 
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>When you invoke $sync() the uci code will load the specified configs into
memory. The config types must be defined in your plugin first, so that fields
that are not present in the configs can be created with their default values.</p>

<p>For more details on how this is done, check the .js files in the plugins under
src/ folder (not pages and widgets, but the main plugin file which is usually
called plugin-name.js or just main.js).</p>

<p>Just like in command line uci, JUCI gives you several ways to access config
elements:</p>

<pre><code>$uci.wireless["@all"] // list of all sections in the wireless config
$uci.wireless["@wifi-device"] // list of only the wifi device sections
$uci.wireless.wl0 // access wl0 section by name (all sections that have a name can be accessed like this)
$uci.wireless.cfg012345 // access a section with an automatically created uci name. 
</code></pre>

<p>Each field in uci section has a "value" member which is current value of that
field. So if you use uci sections in your gui elements you have to use .value
in order to set their values.</p>

<p>JUCI also retains the default and original values of each field so that you can
revert the value to what it was when you loaded the config.</p>

<p>It is also possible to attach validators to each field. Examples are in uci.js
file.</p>

<h2 id="Backend-Code-">Backend Code </h2>

<p>Juci backend mostly consists of scripts that implement ubus functions which become available to the gui code through json rpc. These scripts are simple glue that juci uses to interact with the rest of the system. You can place these scripts in ubus/ folder of your plugin. Each script should have a globally unique name (preferably a name that identifies it as being part of a specific plugin) and it will be placed into /usr/lib/ubus/juci folder on the router.</p>

<p>All of these scripts are then managed by ubus-scriptd service on the router which makes then available on ubus.</p>

<p>ubus-scriptd supports both batch scripts and services. Most of juci backend tasks are usually batch scripts that become ubus objects.</p>

<h2 id="Further-information">Further information</h2>

<p>JUCI documentation can definitely be improved. You can speed up this process by
posting your questions on the issues board on juci github page
(https://github.com/mkschreder/juci/issues).</p>

<h2 id="The-JUCI-Story-">The JUCI Story </h2>

<p>In April 2015 I came in as a consultant at Inteno in the middle of release
cycle for next generation of Iopsys Open Source SDK for Inteno broadband
routers. One of the things that fell on me is quickly adding new functionality
to the existing webgui. I quickly realized that it was not feasible. The
existing gui was written in lua and adding new pages was a bizarre journey of
knocking out html code by calling lua functions. It was bizarre at best and it
was not even Inteno's fault - they used a ready made solution and had on their
todo list for years the task of improving it. It just never came to completion.</p>

<p>So I took on me the task of creating the new gui. In two months I made a
working prototype to what was at the time called luci-express. It got that name
from the fact that originally I was exploring the idea of using nodejs and
express to build it - but then I instead settled for using angular.js and parts
of luci2 (with most of the code from luci2 now removed, but backend such as
rpcd was in fact created specifically for luci2 on openwrt and is still in use
today).</p>

<p>The name luci-express was however not descriptive enough - especially since the
"L" in luci stands for Lua and luci-express was basically writen in javascript.
So I came up with a better name for it instead which came to be the acronym for
Javascript Universal Configuration Interface - and that's how JUCI was born.
Besides, everyone seemed to like it so JUCI became the name.</p>

<p>It took another six months to make juci a worthy contestant for being used in a
production environment. Over time more people joined development and now we are
a few people adding new things to JUCI. It proved to be quite useful and
actually quite nice to work with. It was all made possible with initial support
from Inteno and Iopsys and the examples of already working systems.</p>
